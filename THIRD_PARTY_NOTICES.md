## Native build dependencies

The application build uses LLVM/Clang/lld, zlib 1.3.2, and the public
[PS5 payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk). The bootstrapper
downloads SDK v0.42 after verifying SHA-256
`8cfbc7cd5811e719eb4f0c47eea668d3dc7b40bc8ab11c4a5031d40c23ec02da`.
It downloads zlib 1.3.2 from the upstream source archive after verifying
SHA-256 `bb329a0a2cd0274d05519d61c667c062e06990d72e125ee2dfa8de64f0119d16`
and compiles its static archive locally. Both dependencies remain under ignored
`.deps/native/`, retain their upstream licenses, and are not distributed by
this repository. No Sony SDK file is included.

Target C++ compilation uses the LLVM libc++ headers distributed by the public
SDK. Those headers retain the Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception license recorded
upstream. The application does not redistribute or dynamically load the
complete libc++ or libc++abi archives.

The PS5 ELF converter and FSELF writer in `tooling/native/` are derived from
[SharpProspero](https://github.com/SvenGDK/SharpProspero), Copyright (C) 2026
SvenGDK, GPL-3.0, and were translated to C++ and modified by BlackBearReloaded.

## Host test dependency

The host unit-test target downloads
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) 1.17.0 after verifying
SHA-256 `65fab701d9829d38cb77c14acdc431d2108bfdbf8979e40eb8ae567edf10b27c`.
It remains under ignored `.deps/test/`, retains its BSD-3-Clause license, and
is not linked into any PS5 application, runtime, or package artifact.

## Optional PacBrew dependencies

When selected through `PACBREW_*` build variables, the build downloads the prebuilt ports image
from [ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo)
release `v0.40.2`, verifies its published SHA-256, and extracts only the
`target/user/homebrew` prefix under ignored `.deps/pacbrew/`. It does not
replace the pinned SDK or install files globally. PacBrew recipes and every
linked third-party library retain their upstream licenses; applications must
review those terms before redistribution. DriftCheck selects none.

## Independently authored runtime shim

`tooling/native/libc_builder.cpp` and the manifests under
`tooling/native/runtime/` are independently authored for this project and
licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The generated `runtime/libc.prx` contains
project-authored compatibility stubs, startup code, and semantic loader
metadata. It contains no Sony runtime implementation.

carry matching SPDX identifiers.

DriftCheck's own sources (`src/main.cpp`, `src/pad.*`, `src/stick_analysis.*`,
`installer/`, `tools/build-installer.sh`, `tools/preview*`) and its icon

assets are not included.

No proprietary runtime module, encryption key, or game file is included.
